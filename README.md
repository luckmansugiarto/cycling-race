# Cycling Race
This sample exercise is used top demonstrate a full stack technology using:
**VueJS (Quasar Framework)** for the front-end, **Laravel / Lumen** for the back-end, **MySQL** for the database, and **Docker** containers that serve as the infrastructure

# Requirements
You need to have **Docker** installed on your local machine. This code base was tested using Docker v18.06 under Windows OS. Although it is not tested under Linux OS, usually it would still work.

# Instruction
To run the code:
1. Clone the code base locally by running the following git command
`git clone https://github.com/luckmansugiarto/cycling-race.git <project name>`
2. Open your terminal / command prompt (in windows), navigate to the project's root directory, and run the following docker command
`docker-compose up -d`
